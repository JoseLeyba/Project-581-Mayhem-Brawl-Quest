# Project-581-Mayhem-Brawl-Quest
EECS 581 Project

In the game, players control characters as they progress through levels, battling monsters, collecting power-ups, and facing off against powerful bosses. The objective is to overcome increasingly difficult challenges using strategic movement, combat, and collected abilities. The game features both single-player and two-player modes. In single-player, players face all challenges alone, while in two-player mode, they can either cooperate to defeat enemies together or compete for resources and power-ups. The game's mechanics dynamically adjust to each mode, ensuring balanced gameplay whether players team up or face each other, creating a varied and engaging experience for everyone.

  The layout we used is inspired in the one showed in the "Start Your Game Creation Journey Today! (Godot beginner tutorial)" video, as this is our first experience using Godot it was extremely helpful to start off in the right direction and was used as a base for this sprint. Next sprint we'll design our own levels as one of the requirements.
